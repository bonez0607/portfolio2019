           Hello! I am a designer, front-end developer, and photographer based in Lincoln. 
          Currently, I am an Information Assistant for the USDA National Agroforestry Center, 
          where I do everything from laying out publications and creating custom graphics to developing web-based tools to help users access information more easily.
          In 2018, I successully completed the USDA Forest Service National New Leader Program.
        </p>
        <p>I truly enjoy problem solving being creative &emdash; which is why you'll see a multitude of projects in my portfolio. I'm a firm believer that the skills from each of the categories: Design, Web Development, and Photography overlap within another. This overlap allows me to gain perspective of what is truly needed when I begin a project. </p>
        <p>
          Since 2013, I have also been freelance photographer.
          I've worked with my clients to capture birthdays, weddings, 5k races, products, portraits
          specializing in event and portrait photography. 
          I've captured birthdays, weddings, running events.
