      <blockquote>OMGosh...Joe far exceeded my expectations!  At my motherÂ’s 90th Birthday Party Joe had to work with all ages (3 mos to age 90), he and his assistant were very professional and a joy to work with.  They captured various family groups and some very unforgettable candid shots.  We have Joe to thank when will look back at all the memories that were created at this event. </blockquote>

           Hello! I am a designer, front-end developer, and photographer based in Lincoln. 
          Currently, I am an Information Assistant for the USDA National Agroforestry Center, 
          where I do everything from laying out publications and creating custom graphics to developing web-based tools to help users access information more easily.
          In 2018, I successully completed the USDA Forest Service National New Leader Program.
        </p>
        <p>I truly enjoy problem solving being creative &emdash; which is why you'll see a multitude of projects in my portfolio. I'm a firm believer that the skills from each of the categories: Design, Web Development, and Photography overlap within another. This overlap allows me to gain perspective of what is truly needed when I begin a project. </p>
        <p>
          Since 2013, I have also been freelance photographer.
          I've worked with my clients to capture birthdays, weddings, 5k races, products, portraits
          specializing in event and portrait photography. 
          I've captured birthdays, weddings, running events 
        </p>
