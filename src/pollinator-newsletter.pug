                p Because saving the pollinators is a big concern across several agencies, I began to look at what others were doing to raise awareness about pollinators. One of our partners, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, specializes in pollinator conservation. They had a myriad of materials to look through and compare. 

                p The <a href="https://500px.com/leejeffries">Lee Jeffries</a> portfolio provided inspiration for the final product. 

                p To help model the butterfly looked through the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/">amazing collection</a> USGS has on FlickreUSGS portfolio of Bee inventory. I also searched in Google images for profile and facing camera images of butterflies. 

                p Lastly, I looked back to my younger years remembering the animation of "A bug's life" and "ants." I analyzed how they conveyed emotion through the animated insects.

                p This edition of our newsletter was geared around pollinators. Articles within it would explore the issues surrounding pollinators and highlight programs that landowners could use to help provide habitat and food for pollinators. 

                p Initial discussions involved before/after images of what a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1672866/this-is-what-our-grocery-shelves-would-look-like-without-bees">supermarket produce section would look like without pollinators</a>. We also come across a comic strip that portrayed a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/animals-nectar-bee-insect-bug-hive-tmcn3996_low.jpg">homeless bee</a> willing to work for nectar, we explored pollinators being super hero group like the Avengers. We settled on the super hero team and moved forward. 

                p In my spare time, I had been working on developing my photography skills and was looking at how to take better black and white photos. In doing so I came across the portfolio of <a href="https://500px.com/leejeffries">Lee Jeffries</a> who takes portraits of the homeless. His images are able to to tell a story, you are able to see the pain, suffering, personality, and hope in his images and it stuck with me. 

                p On my walk from my car to the office I began to think back to the comic strip and was thinking we could apply the style of Lee Jeffries to the comic strip to create a compelling story that pollinators need habitat and food. 

                p I shared my thoughts with the team and we decided to shift gears. I  began thinking of how I could best accomplish this. Can this be done through photo manipulation? Maybe I could create the image by building a 3d model. 

                p The issue with the photo manipulation idea is there aren't that many (if any) headshots out there of depressed pollinators... So I went with option #2.

                p I had experience with an open source 3D software called Blender 3D and figured I could model the butterfly in that program, used the program to provide the appropriate lighting and then do the final touches in Photoshop.

                    figcaption This is the model I created from scratch in Blender 3D. The hair was added using Blender's particle feature.

                p When modeling in 3D I go straight to images of the object in real life. This was no different I searched Google images and Flickr. I also used the macro images that the USGS bee inventory had created. This allowed me to look at the various details I would need to incorporate in my model to pass it off as semi-realistic. I used a variety of custom textures I created as well as textures from <a href="textures.com">textures.com</a>.

                    figcaption The butterfly spots on the left and the stripes on the abdomen were textures I created in Photoshop as I was unable to find the textures I need online. 

                p Once I had my images, I set to modeling. The body was relatively easy to create and just involve modeling spheres into the appropriate shapes. In my research I found the key to capturing emotion was to treat the antennae to create moods. In the same way a person can understand a dog's emotional state through it's tail, I could manipulate the antennae to achieve the effect I was looking for. The rest of the emotion was created through the dramatic lighting. It is high contrast and while there isnâ€™t much rim lighting in Lee Jeffries images, I decided it helped bring focus to the butterflies face, to offset the amount of white that was in its body. 

                p In addition, to the creation of the cover, I was also responsible for the complete layout of the newsletter.
