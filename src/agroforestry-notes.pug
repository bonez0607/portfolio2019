                p This project came about for a couple of reasons. One of the main reasons, was new research and information had come out since some of the earliest Agroforestry Notes were written and our team wanted to update them to be more current, relevant, but most importantly - more accurate.  We would also no longer be re-printing these items as they went out of stock. We found that as our online PDFs became more popular we were finding there was less of a need to print out this particular serious. However, our audience was still interested in the material, based on analytics results we studied.

                p The long-term view of this would be an item that would eventually take on a more interactive approach to the information that was delivered. I had started by looking at interactive story-telling techniques. Naturally, I came across the New York Times interactive stories - while this project wasn’t going to accomplish this yet, it was good to think how this project could eventually evolve into that. 

                p I looked around at how news agencies and blogs delivery their information, what were consistencies across the board and what leeway did I have as a designer to make this our own. 

                p I also looked back at all of the Agroforestry Notes from the 90s and looked at how the publication series itself evolved. I thought about what I could keep that maintained the recognition.

                p These notes were originally design to be hole-punched, stuck in a binder, and taken out to the field by resource professionals. They were black and white because it was less expensive than 4-color printing. 

                p We decided to continue publishing online PDFs, but thought that this was a good time to consider giving this series a bit of a facelift. 

                p We were no longer bound to black and white as the documents would be viewed digitally or printed out by the user themselves. There was no longer a need to saddle stitch, which required design the product to have pages in multiples of four.  As I designed this ‘new’ look, I went over the various elements that I could keep. I felt this would make this update feel like an extension of the series, rather than an entirely new product. 

                p With this update, there is also a vision of eventually getting these out of PDF format and turning them into more web friendly format. So I consideration into how these items would look as web pages and looked to see if I needed to make any adjustments to the design.
