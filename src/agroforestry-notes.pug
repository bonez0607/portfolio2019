                p The decision had been made that we would no longer be printing Agroforestry Notes. We decided it would be a good time to update the look and feel of the series.

                p The long-term view of this would be an item that would eventually take on a more interactive approach to the information that was delivered. I had started by looking at interactive story-telling techniques. Naturally, I came across the New York Times interactive stories - while this project wasnâ€™t going to accomplish this yet, it was good to think how this project could eventually evolve into that. 

                p I looked around at how news agencies and blogs delivery their information, what were consistencies across the board and what leeway did I have as a designer to make this our own. 

                p I also looked back at all of the Agroforestry Notes from the 90s and looked at how the publication series itself evolved. I thought about what I could keep that maintained the recognition.
